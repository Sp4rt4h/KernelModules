# KernelModules
To compile the Kernel Modules, run the following command
1: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r` //This downloads the header files needed to compile the modules

After you have done this, you should have the header files that match your kernel id which you can get using the command "uname -r", stored at /usr/src/
